# Numerical-Control-Coding-
Numerical control (also computer numerical control, and commonly called CNC) is the automated control of machining tools (such as drills, lathes, mills and 3D printers) by means of a computer.

there are 2 codes used in the CNC machine, such as:
- G-codes are used to command specific movements of the machine, such as machine moves or drilling functions.
- M-codes are miscellaneous machine commands that do not command axis motion.
